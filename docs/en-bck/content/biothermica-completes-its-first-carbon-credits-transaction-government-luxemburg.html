                          <p><strong>Montreal, February 6, 2007</strong>: Evolution Markets Inc. announces today it has
                            brokered a trade of carbon reduction credits under the Kyoto Protocol’s Clean Development
                            Mechanism (CDM) between the Government of Luxembourg and Biothermica Energy Inc. The sale of
                            certified emissions reductions (CERs) from its landfill gas-to-energy project in El Salvador
                            marks the first trade by Biothermica Energy, a Montreal based project developer.</p>
                          <p>Under this transaction, Biothermica Energy agrees to sell 325,000 CERs to the Government of
                            Luxembourg. Biothermica Energy is selling carbon credits created from its landfill
                            gas-to-energy project at the Nejapa Landfill Site in El Salvador. The Nejapa project
                            qualifies under the Kyoto Protocol’s Clean Development Mechanism, and credits sold to the
                            Government of Luxembourg will be generated between 2006 and 2012.</p>
                          <p>Thanks to the know-how developed by Biothermica Energy over 20 years in landfill gas
                            recovery and in the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the company realizes one of
                            the first Canadian projects in this particular field in accordance with the Clean
                            Development Mechanism. "The carbon market is presently in full swing,” according to Mr. Guy
                            Drouin, president of Biothermica. “And although the Canadian government has not yet endorsed
                            carbon trading, we do not hesitate to invest in such projects abroad considering the
                            considerable market-based opportunities that exist to counter the GHG emission responsible
                            for climate change.”</p>
                          <p>“Biothermica’s trade with the Government of Luxembourg is a perfect example of how the
                            Clean Development Mechanism is designed to work,” said Andrew Ertel, President &amp; CEO of
                            Evolution Markets Inc. “Carbon financing from the sale of CERs makes this El Salvadoran
                            landfill gas-to-energy project possible. On the other side, Luxembourg is able to reduce its
                            overall greenhouse gas emissions.”</p>
                          <p>The Nejapa landfill receives municipal solid waste from the San Salvador metropolitan area.
                            This two-phase project will initially collect and flare methane gas. At a later stage, the
                            project will complete a 6MW landfill gas-to-electricity system, creating further greenhouse
                            gas emissions reductions. In addition, Biothermica Energy’s Nejapa project was the first to
                            receive a guarantee from the Multilateral Guarantee Agency (MIGA) of the World Bank in July
                            2006. The MIGA guarantee covers certain sovereign and non-commercial risks, which might
                            affect the performance of the project. The Nejapa project is registered with the CDM
                            Executive Board (No. 0167).</p>
                          <p>“We are very pleased to have completed this first trade,” said Mr. Drouin. “With its sound
                            and verifiable method for reducing greenhouse gases and the World Bank’s MIGA guarantee, the
                            Nejapa project was well structured for the market. Ultimately, this trade demonstrates the
                            ability to leverage carbon markets to bring the latest landfill gas-to-energy technology to
                            Latin America, ultimately benefiting the global environment.”</p>
                          <p>The Clean Development Mechanism is a market tool created under the Kyoto Protocol to
                            encourage investment in greenhouse gas emissions reduction projects in the developing world.
                            Developed countries that have committed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions under the
                            Protocol may use credits derived from CDM projects to meet their obligations. Luxembourg has
                            signed and ratified the Kyoto Protocol and is part of the European Union’s group of nations
                            that have committed to cumulatively reduce greenhouse gas emissions 8% below 1990 emissions
                            by the year 2012. In this context, Luxembourg has committed itself to a 28% reduction
                            target.</p>
