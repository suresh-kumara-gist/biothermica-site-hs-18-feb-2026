                              <p>Coal mining activities release a large amount of methane. As methane is a potent
                                greenhouse gas (GHG) with a global warming potential (GWP) 25 times that of carbon
                                dioxide, it is estimated that global annual methane emissions from coal mining could
                                represent more than 1 billion tons carbon dioxide equivalent by 2019. Underground mines
                                are by far the largest source of fugitive methane emissions in the coal sector,
                                representing about 90% of total emissions. The control of methane concentrations
                                underground is crucial to ensure the safety of miners. Two methods are used to reduce
                                concentration in the mine working areas: ventilation and gas drainage.</p>
                              <h4>VAM (Ventilation Air Methane):</h4>
                              <p>A large volume of air is circulated throughout the mine working area to dilute in-mine
                                concentrations of methane well below explosive levels. High powered exhaust mine fans
                                located on the surface enable this ventilation air methane (VAM) to be vented to the
                                atmosphere. It is estimated that about 70% of all global coal mining-related emissions
                                are from VAM, so global VAM emissions are estimated to be in the range of 700 MtCO2e per
                                year. Despite containing a lot of potential energy, the extremely dilute concentration
                                of methane in VAM (typically below 1%) has been a barrier to its valorization. <a

                                power.</p>

                                  Methane)</a>:</h4>
                              <p>Drainage systems are typically used to supplement ventilation systems. They are
                                designed to remove methane either in advance of, or behind, the mining working face.
                                These systems involve drilling boreholes, either from the surface or inside the mine, to
                                drain methane from the coal seam, surrounding strata, or underground workings. The gas
                                captured by these methane drainage techniques is called Coal Mine Methane (CMM). Unused
                                CMM can be mixed with VAM supplied to a Vamox® RTO system to enrich and regulate methane
                                concentration, maximizing the project’s profitability.</p>

                          <p>As the abatement of VAM is not mandatory, the main incentive to implement VAM abatement
                            projects in the U.S. is the generation of carbon credits. Indeed, since methane is a
                            greenhouse gas (GHG) 25 times more potent than CO2, GHG emissions can be reduced by simply
                            capturing and oxidizing methane. Hence, each ton of methane oxidized results in a net
                            emission reduction equivalent to 22.25 tCO2e.</p>

                          <p> </p>
                          <p>With the adoption of the <a

                              Capture Protocol</a> by The California Air Resources Board (CARB) on July 1, 2014, VAM
                            projects in the U.S. are now eligible to produce carbon credits that can be sold on the
                            regulated California-Québec cap-and-trade program. Québec has also adopted a <a
                              href="http://legisquebec.gouv.qc.ca/en/ShowDoc/cr/Q-2, r. 46.1">protocol</a> covering VAM
                            projects in Canada.</p>
                          <p>The selling of carbon credits ensures the bankability of GHG emission reduction projects.
                            By securing a revenue stream in hard currency, carbon credits provide a means of financing
                            projects that reduce GHG emissions, thereby mitigating climate change while contributing to
                            sustainable development.</p>
                          <p>A minimum selling price of approximately ~10$/tCO2e to ~12$/tCO2e (depending on methane
                            concentration) is typically required to deliver attractive rates of return. Over the last
                            few years, ARBOC selling price has exceeded this minimum selling price, fostering projects
                            opportunities. United States and Canada are currently the only two jurisdictions in the
                            world where the selling price of carbon credits generated from VAM abatement projects is
                            high enough to secure the profitability of VAM abatement project with the sale of carbon
                            credits as the sole project’s revenue.</p>
                          <p>According to <a
                              href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-03/documents/vam-exhaust-characterization-july2010.pdf">U.S.
                              EPA</a>, total VAM Emissions in the U.S. were estimated to 2.4 Million Cubic Meters of
                            Methane (MCM) and 29 vent shafts were reported to discharge VAM at an average methane
                            concentration high enough to be economically viable (typically &gt;~0.4%).</p>

                          <h4>Generating Power from VAM</h4>
                          <p>Despite its low methane concentration, VAM contains a lot of energy! A typical shaft
                            venting 300,000 scfm (500,000 Nm3/hr) of VAM at 1%v/v contains close to 50 MWt of potential
                            energy wasted to the atmosphere (see graph below). The Vamox® Regenerative Thermal Oxidizer
                            (RTO) technology is an effective way to release and value this energy.</p>
                          <p>Possible end-uses include generating hot water for district heating and/or generating
                            electric power. Different strategies may be implemented to retrieve heat from the RTO. For
                            thermal heating (low-grade heat), the simplest approach consists in recovering heat from the
                            stack using an heat exchanger. Electric power may also be generated from the stack by
                            coupling an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) system. However, to maximize power generation, a
                            preferred approach consists in collecting heat directly from the combustion chamber where
                            gas temperature is much higher (high-grade heat) and supply that energy to a steam cycle for
                            electric power generation.</p>
