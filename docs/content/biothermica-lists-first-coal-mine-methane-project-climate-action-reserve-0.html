                          <p><strong>Montreal, Canada, February 2, 2010</strong> – Biothermica today announced the
                            listing with the Climate Action Reserve of its pioneering ventilation air methane (VAM)
                            project at Jim Walter Resources’ No. 4 Mine in Alabama (USA). This is the first coal mine
                            methane activity to be listed with this recognized offsets program.</p>
                          <p>Featuring Biothermica’s VAMOX® system, the demonstration project complies with version 1.0
                            of the Climate Action Reserve’s Coal Mine Methane Project Protocol. As a member of the
                            Reserve’s Coal Mine Methane workgroup, Biothermica actively participated in the protocol
                            development process.</p>
                          <p>“This new milestone brings us closer to the monetization of the first carbon offset credits
                            resulting from VAM abatement in America” said Nicolas Duplessis, Biothermica’s Director of
                            Development. “We always seek to maximize the value of our carbon projects and, looking
                            forward, we see a strong potential in the Climate Action Reserve’s rigorous protocol”.</p>
                          <p>After one year of operation, Biothermica expects to generate approximately 27,000 carbon
                            offset credits which will be registered with the Climate Action Reserve and sold on the
                            North American market. Following this initial ramp-up period, production is expected to
                            reach approximately 35,000 carbon offset credits each year.</p>
                          <p>The project’s success is also a result of the close cooperation with the management and
                            technical team of Jim Walter Resources, Biothermica’s partner. “Jim Walter Resources has
                            found a great partner in Biothermica. We appreciate their experienced and realistic approach
                            to carbon projects” said Rich Donnelly, Vice President of Engineering. “Getting involved
                            with VAM oxidation early on also testifies to our dedication to reduce the environmental
                            impact of our operations”.</p>
                          <p>Building on this achievement, Biothermica plans to develop similar ventures with other
                            mines and create value from their VAM. Biothermica seeks to get involved as a risk sharing
                            partner and sponsor of VAM oxidation projects, thereby allowing mines to focus on their
                            primary activity.</p>
