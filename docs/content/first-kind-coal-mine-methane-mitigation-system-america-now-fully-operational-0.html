                          <p><strong>Montreal, Canada, April 13, 2009</strong> – Biothermica today announced that its
                            pioneering VAMOX™ coal mine methane (CMM) abatement system is fully operational at Jim
                            Walter Resources’ mine no. 4 in Brookwood, Alabama. For the first time in America,
                            ventilation air methane (VAM) is being destroyed at an active coal mine, all the while
                            generating bankable carbon credits.</p>
                          <p>Approved by the U.S. Department of Labor’s Mine Safety &amp; Health Administration (MSHA),
                            the demonstration system oxidized methane for the first time as originally planned on
                            January 26, 2009. Capturing 30,000 ft³/min of mine ventilation air, this medium-size unit
                            will achieve greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions amounting to some 40,000 tons of CO2
                            equivalent each year, the same as removing 8,000 cars from the road.</p>
                          <p>“We are extremely satisfied with the performance and reliability of our system after only a
                            few weeks of operation” said Nicolas Duplessis, Director of VAMOX™ Development. Guy Drouin,
                            President of Biothermica, added: “Mine ventilation air accounts for 50 to 70% of all CMM
                            emissions and the VAMOX™ can certainly play a significant role in helping the coal mining
                            industry minimize its environmental impact. Building on the success of our venture in
                            Alabama, we plan to develop similar projects in close partnership with other U.S. mines.”
                          </p>
                          <p>Well established as a successful carbon project developer, Biothermica always seeks to
                            generate high quality carbon credits. For this reason, the project is fully validated in
                            accordance with the Voluntary Carbon Standard (VCS) and is one of the first to be listed on
                            the new APX VCS Registry. More information regarding this initiative can be found at <a
                              href="http://www.vcsregistry.com/">www.vcsregistry.com</a></p>
                          <p>“Once again, Jim Walter Resources leads the industry by implementing a new technology that
                            captures and utilizes methane to achieve a cleaner coal production” said Thomas E. McNider,
                            General Manager of Mining Engineering. “The VAMOX™ is a simple solution since it requires no
                            modification to existing mine equipments and remains independent from our ventilation
                            system.”</p>
                          <p>Using the proven principle of regenerative thermal oxidation (RTO), the VAMOX™ captures and
                            mitigates VAM emissions before this potent GHG is released to the atmosphere. Strong of its 
                            15 year expertise with RTO, Biothermica developed the VAMOX™ to offer coal mines a safe,
                            simple and profitable solution to significantly decrease their carbon footprint.</p>
