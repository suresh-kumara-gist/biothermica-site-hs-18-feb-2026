<p>Biothermica will use its VAMOXTM regenerative thermal oxidation system to destroy ventilation air methane (VAM - methane gas contained in mine exhaust air) before this potent GHG is released to the atmosphere. This demonstration project will achieve GHG emission reductions of some 40 000 tons of CO2 equivalent (tCO2e) annually.</p>
<p>“Once more, Biothermica positions itself as a pioneer of GHG mitigation initiatives, as we will be the first company to oxidize VAM at an active coal mine in America” said Guy Drouin, President of Biothermica. “Our project will also be one of the first in the world to generate an income stream based on the selling of carbon credits resulting from VAM destruction”.</p>
<p>VAM constitutes 60% to 70% of the GHG emissions from underground coal mines. In 2007, VAM emissions made-up 5% of all man-induced GHG emissions (about 300 million tCO2e). The U.S.A. is the second largest contributor with about 18% of this total.</p>
<p>“Historically considered as waste, ventilation air can now turn into a valuable asset that can be sold as carbon credits on the market” said Thomas E. McNider, General Manager of Mining Engineering at Jim Walter Resources. “Moreover, Biothermica’s VAMOXTM requires no modification to our existing mine equipments and remains independent from our ventilation systems”.</p>
<p>Biothermica plans to develop VAM oxidation projects based on the monetization of carbon credits across the world under different GHG emission reduction schemes such as the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
<p>Biothermica has already established itself as one of the best performing CDM project developers in the landfill gas sector with its project in Nejapa, El Salvador. This project exceeded carbon credits production targets within its first year of operation.</p>
